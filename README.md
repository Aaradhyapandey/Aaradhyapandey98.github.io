# Plain-Academic Template
A truly simple website template for academics.


It was developed with simplicity in mind (both in terms of style and in code complexity).


Three websites based on this template: [here](http://andreacerulli.github.io/), [here](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Bootle/) and [here](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~rezaei).
